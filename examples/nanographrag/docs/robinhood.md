## GameStop Controversy

## Payment for Order Flow

Robinhood's business model relies heavily on payment for order flow (PFOF), where market makers pay for the right to execute trades. This practice has faced regulatory scrutiny.

## Competition

Robinhood competes with traditional brokerages (Charles Schwab, Fidelity), fintech apps (Webull, SoFi), and crypto exchanges (Coinbase).
