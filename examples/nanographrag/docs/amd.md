# Advanced Micro Devices

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. AMD develops computer processors, graphics processors, and related technologies for the consumer and business markets.

## History

AMD was founded on May 1, 1969, by Jerry Sanders and a group of engineers from Fairchild Semiconductor. The company started as a second-source manufacturer of Intel's processors before developing its own CPU designs.

## Leadership

## Manufacturing

Unlike Intel, AMD is a fabless semiconductor company. TSMC manufactures AMD's most advanced chips, including Ryzen and EPYC processors using 5nm and 3nm process nodes.

## Competition

AMD competes with:

- Intel in x86 processors
- NVIDIA in graphics and AI accelerators
- ARM-based processors from Qualcomm, Apple, and Ampere

## Market Position

AMD has gained significant market share from Intel in both consumer and data center markets, particularly with its Ryzen and EPYC product lines.
